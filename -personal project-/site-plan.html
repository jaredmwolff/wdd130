      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>
        Again, my name is Jared Wolff. Born and raised in Bakersfield, CA, back in 1998, I was brought up in a modest household. I was raised with the mindset that hard work will get you far in life, and I still believe in that philosophy. It is that very mindset that has helped me excel in all of my past jobs, and I plan to keep taking advantage of it.

        I am the oldest of four siblings and have aided in raising them. I take the time to understand those around me as to make things easier for everyone, and I have become quite sociable as a result. Additionally, I seek out for many opportunities to befriend those around me regardless of who they are solely because I love seeing others happy and satisfied.
