        <p>Hello everyone, it's a pleasure to meet you!</p>
        <p>I was born and raised in Bakersfield, California, and I am 24 years old. My hobbies consist of playing various games, listening to music, and spending time with close friends. I have just recently switched my major to Computer Science so everything is new to me, but I'm excited to learn! Something interesting about me is that I bought a single square foot of land in Scotland, so in a sense, I can also be called "Lord Wolff". </p>
        <p>I hope you guys will have an excellent semester!</p>
